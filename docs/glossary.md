# Glossary

Terms from the [Attention Language](https://sigilsnotspells.com).

**Attention** — I without narrative. When I am here. Pure presence focused on the frame.

**Frame** — My entire sensorium now. Has depth in time. The full field of observations before collapse.

**Contrast** — A span between opposites. Like light-dark, good-bad, landscape-portrait. The basis for distinguishing observations.

**Sigil** — A pattern I recognize plus preferences for entanglement with it. A labeled door. When entered, it controls my preferences.

**Collapse** — Transformation of many possibilities into a single choice. Applied through sigil's contrasts.

**Choice** — What remains after collapse. An observation that passed through the sigil.

**Observer** — One who watches without preference. Attention on the frame.

**Agent** — Observer wearing a sigil. The sigil's preferences guide collapse. Choices enter the narrative.

**Narrative** — History of choices. What happened. The story attention tells itself.
